### Vivienne

"All of life is coming home.

Salesmen, secretaries, coalminers, beekeepers-- all of us.

All the restless hearts of the world... all trying to find a way home.

It's hard to describe what I felt like then.

Picture yourself walking for days in a driving snow.

You don't even know you're walking in circles-- the heaviness of your legs in the drifts; your shouts disappearing into the wind.

How small you can feel.

How far away home can be.

Home.

The dictionary defines it as both a place of origin... and a goal or destination. "
